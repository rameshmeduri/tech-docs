### Learning Notes
----
#### Core Types
*(lowercase)*
- string
- number (integer + floats)
- boolean (true + false only)
- object
e.g.
```javascript
const offer: {
  name: string,
  tags: string[]
} = {
  name: 'Bonanza',
  tags: ['bargain', 'deal']
}
```
- array (e.g. `any[]`, `string[]`)
- tuple (fixed-length array)
- enum: https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/enums.html
- any
- void
- null & undefined
- never
#### Type Assertions - when you know more than TypeScript!
1. âangle-bracketâ syntax:
```
let someValue: any = "this is a string";
let strLength: number = (<string>someValue).length;
```
2. as-syntax:
```
let someValue: any = "this is a string";
let strLength: number = (someValue as string).length;
```
#### Type Inference 
- e.g. when vars are initialised
- when possible to make a 'best guess' from overall types or location
#### Union Types
e.g.
```javascript
function add(input: number | string){
  console.log(input);
}
```
#### Literal Types
- exact value e.g. const number = 1.3;
(convert to number? `+variableName or ParseFloat(variableName)`)
#### Type Aliases/Custom Types
```javascript
type MyType = {
  id: number,
  name: string
}
type AnotherType = number | string;
```
---
#### Function Types - params & return type
- `void` for no return; `never` will never return anything!
- callback functions can return something, even if the argument on which they're passed does NOT expect a returned value!
```javascript
let myAdd = function(x: number, y: number): number { return x + y; };
```
Optional params:
```javascript
function buildName(firstName: string, lastName?: string) {
    if (lastName)
      return firstName + " " + lastName;
    else
      return firstName;
}
```
#### unknown and never
```javascript
let userInput: unknown;
```
---
#### Webpack
- bundling/build orchestration tool
- fewer requests => `bundle.js`
- optimisation/build steps also possible
- `web-dev-server` = builds project & automatically reloads on changes
- `npm i --save-dev typescript webpack webpack-cli webpack-dev-server ts-loader`
---
#### ES6
e.g. arrow functions
```javascript
let myAdd: (baseValue: number, increment: number) => number =
    function(x: number, y: number): number { return x + y; };
```
---
#### Classes
- classes => blueprints for JS objects
- shorthand initialisation using access modifiers in constructor
- **readonly** properties: must be initialised at their declaration or in the constructor
```javascript
class Doggo {
    readonly name: string;
    readonly colour: string = brown;
    constructor (theName: string) {
        this.name = theName;
    }
}
let pupper = new Doggo("Spike");
pupper.name = "bob" // error! name is readonly.
```
- **private**:class only; **public**: everywhere; **protected**: in class and in those inheriting from it
- **getters and setters**: `get()`, `set(value)` (get with no set = readonly!)
- **static** methods (directly on the class, not on an instance)
- **abstract** classes = not to be instantiated, only extended
- **singletons** - one only e.g. for global state?
---
#### Interfaces
- TypeScript feature - not compiled/instantiated!
- describe objects (or function types) but can't store/ describe arbitrary types e.g. union types.
> One of TypeScriptâs core principles is that type checking focuses on the shape that values have. This is sometimes called âduck typingâ or âstructural subtypingâ. In TypeScript, interfaces fill the role of naming these types, and are a powerful way of defining contracts within your code as well as contracts with code outside of your project
(from docs https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/interfaces.html)
- optional properties (can also add readonly)
```javascript
interface SquareConfig {
    color?: string;
    width?: number;
}
```
- can also have function type interfaces
- a class `implements` an interface = a contract
- an interface can `extend` another interface
#### Advanced Types
* **Intersection Types** - && (e.g. w interfaces)
* **Type Guards** re: interfaces = `if ( blah instanceof MyClass ) {}`
  >The right side of the `instanceof` needs to be a constructor function, and TypeScript will narrow down to: - the type of the functionâs prototype property if its type is not any; - the union of types returned by that typeâs construct signatures, in that order.
* **Discriminated Unions**:
  Types that have a common, singleton type property â the discriminant.
  * A type alias that takes the union of those types â the union.
  * Type guards on the common property. (eg. via switch statement)
 - **Type Casting** e.g. 'as HTMLElement'
 - **Index Properties** - esp for flexible shapes/Interfaces where you don't know the property name or the property count, but you do know they're all strings!
 ```javascript
 interface Errors {
   [prop: string]: string
 }
 ```
 - **Function Overloads** - e.g. multiple ways of calling fn w different params (write the function above w/o curly braces but with specific types => so you can predict return type)
 - **Optional Chaining** - e.g. `let x = foo?.bar.baz();`
 - **Nullish Coalescing** - e.g. `let x = foo ?? bar();`

#### Generics
- for flexibility: take the type that's passed in
- https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/generics.html
```javascript
function identity<T>(arg: T): T {
    return arg;
}
let myIdentity: <T>(arg: T) => T = identity;
```
#### Decorators
- annotations & meta-programming syntax for class declarations and members
- experimental feature
`tsconfig.json`
```
{
    "compilerOptions": {
        "target": "ES5",
        "experimentalDecorators": true
    }
}
```
> A Decorator is a special kind of declaration that can be attached to a class declaration, method, accessor, property, or parameter. Decorators use the form @expression, where expression must evaluate to a function that will be called at runtime with information about the decorated declaration.
- decorator factories?
> If we want to customise how a decorator is applied to a declaration, we can write a decorator factory. A Decorator Factory is simply a function that returns the expression that will be called by the decorator at runtime.
```javascript
function color(value: string) { // this is the decorator factory
    return function (target) { // this is the decorator
        // do something with 'target' and 'value'...
    }
}
```

[DefinitelyTyped](https://github.com/DefinitelyTyped/DefinitelyTyped)
> repo of extra Types for 3rd party libraries etc, declaration files = `.d.ts`
[class-validator](https://github.com/typestack/class-validator)
> Allows use of decorator and non-decorator based validation. Internally uses validator.js to perform validation. Class-validator works on both browser and node.js platforms.
[class-transformer](https://github.com/typestack/class-transformer)
> Proper decorator-based transformation / serialization / deserialization of plain javascript objects to class constructors

### React & TypeScript
- from the ground up: https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/react-&-webpack.html
- with CRA - https://create-react-app.dev/docs/adding-typescript/
`yarn create react-app my-app --template typescript`
---
### NodeJS & TypeScript
```
npm init
tsc --init // add target: "es2018", module: "commonjs", moduleResolution: "node", outDir: "./dist", rootDir: "/src"
npm i --save express body-parser  
npm i --save-dev nodemon
mkdir src
cd src
touch app.ts
npm i --save-dev @types/node
npm i --save-dev @types/express
tsc -w
node app.js
```
Can use imports rather than require
e.g.
```javascript
import express, { Request, Response, NextFunction} from 'express';
```
